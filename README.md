## 🧭 Overview

**BTX (Bitcoin Transaction Extension)** is a scalable, privacy-focused Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin, designed to support both human and machine transactions with instant finality, strong privacy, and global accessibility—without compromising Bitcoin’s decentralization or security.

BTX is fully anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain and introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based transaction model that finalizes payments in ~5 seconds under normal conditions. It includes dual wallet logic (Human + AI), full offline transaction capability, and a modular governance architecture.

This whitepaper defines the complete BTX design, including:
- Bitcoin-anchored transaction finality
- DAG structure and validator roles
- Fee logic and validator/miner incentive alignment
- Wallet policies, privacy modes, and offline relay
- Minting/redemption logic and BTC reserve model
- Modular governance and upgrade system

## 📎 Key Features

- **Bitcoin-Native**: All transactions are settled in MOTO, fully pegged to BTC (1 BTC = 10,000,000,000 MOTO).
- **No Bridges or Wrapped Tokens**: MOTO is minted and burned via BTC-backed contracts with native anchoring.
- **Fast Finality**: ~5 seconds global finality in normal conditions, with **instant local finality** in person-to-person or PoS settings.
- **Offline Capable**: Transactions can be staged via QR, file transfer, SMS, or mesh networks.
- **Privacy by Default**: All transactions use encrypted addresses, decoys, dummy TXs, and role blending.
- **Dual Wallet Design**: Human wallets (≥ 1 MOTO only) and AI wallets (support sub-MOTO, batching).
- **Sustainable Fees**: Percentage-based with min/max caps, adjusted for BTC purchasing power.
- **Validator + Miner Incentives**: Dynamic fee split strengthens both BTC Layer-1 and BTX Layer-2 ecosystems.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Upgradeable modules with multisig Bitcoin Core Dev advisory system.
- **Anchored Audit Trail**: Every BTX DAG state is periodically anchored into the Bitcoin blockchain.

## ⚡ Finality Summary

> **In real-world conditions, most transactions achieve practical finality in seconds—even before full DAG confirmation.**

- If **both wallets are locally connected** (e.g., via QR, PoS, Bluetooth), **local finality** is instant.
- Once **one wallet submits the transaction online**, it enters the DAG and is **globally finalized within ~5 seconds**.
- The transaction is irreversible once globally finalized.
- If **both wallets are lost or never go online**, the MOTO (and corresponding BTC backing) is permanently unspendable—mirroring Bitcoin’s lost key behavior.

# BTX Threat Mitigation Summary

## Purpose
This document outlines key long-term threats to Bitcoin and explains how BTX (Bitcoin Transaction Layer) addresses or mitigates each of them, reinforcing Bitcoin’s resilience, neutrality, and sustainability.

---

## 1. Fee Collapse from Hodling & Low Transaction Velocity

**Threat**: As Bitcoin becomes a long-term store of value, on-chain transaction volume declines. This risks insufficient miner fees once block subsidies expire.

**BTX Mitigation**:
- Migrates high-volume, low-cost transactions to BTX
- Shares BTX Layer-2 transaction fees dynamically with Bitcoin miners
- Anchors periodically to Bitcoin, keeping miners economically aligned

---

## 2. Block Template Censorship & Mining Pool Centralization

**Threat**: Centralized mining pools control which transactions are included, introducing risks of censorship, front-running, and regulatory filtering.

**BTX Mitigation**:
- Proposes a BTX-governed, decentralized block template builder (Appendix H)
- Prioritizes fee-maximizing TX selection with neutrality rules
- Offers smaller miners access to clean, optimized block templates
- Ensures system-critical BTX anchors are included without market distortion

---

## 3. Layer 2 Fragmentation & Alt-Layer Capture

**Threat**: Competing custodial or altcoin-based Layer 2 solutions may siphon off users, breaking Bitcoin’s settlement supremacy.

**BTX Mitigation**:
- Fully Bitcoin-native (1:1 BTC/MOTO peg)
- No new consensus, no custodians, no staking
- Built to scale user payments while remaining fully anchored to Bitcoin

---

## 4. Spam & Blockspace Abuse (e.g., NFTs, Ordinals)

**Threat**: Arbitrary data (images, inscriptions) bloats Bitcoin blocks, displacing economically useful transactions.

**BTX Mitigation**:
- Optional spam filters in the BTX template builder
- Governance by BTX validators and Bitcoin Core-aligned developers
- Helps prioritize real transaction data in miner templates

---

## 5. UX Inertia & Loss of Relevance

**Threat**: Bitcoin risks becoming too slow or expensive for everyday usage compared to altcoins.

**BTX Mitigation**:
- ~5-second finality on BTX
- Human and AI wallet support
- Offline, SMS, and low-bandwidth transaction compatibility
- No need for trusted third parties

---

## 6. Regulatory Fragmentation & Regional Bans

**Threat**: Local bans or compliance mandates fragment Bitcoin’s network or limit accessibility.

**BTX Mitigation**:
- Default privacy at the Layer-2 level
- Mesh, SMS, and offline compatibility
- Modular governance allows for jurisdictional adaptation without compromising core logic

---

## 7. Energy or Hashrate Collapse (e.g., ESG attacks)

**Threat**: Coordinated energy regulation or market shocks may cause rapid hashrate drops, undermining Bitcoin’s security.

**BTX Mitigation**:
- Dynamic fee split increases miner compensation when Bitcoin difficulty drops
- Provides stabilizing revenue during hashrate downturns

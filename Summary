# BTX in 2 Pages  
*A scalable, private, and offline-friendly Bitcoin L2—no tokens, no bridges, no compromises.*

## **Why BTX?**  
Bitcoin faces two existential threats:  
1. **Miner fee collapse** as block rewards dwindle and HODLing reduces transactions.  
2. **Underfunded Core development**, risking long-term security.  

BTX solves both by anchoring a high-throughput DAG to Bitcoin, recycling fees to miners (15–50%) and Core devs (1%).  

---

## **How It Works**  
### **1. Bitcoin-Anchored DAG**  
- **Transactions**: Confirm 2 prior TXs in a DAG (parallel processing, ~10k TPS).  
- **Anchoring**: Snapshots hashed to Bitcoin every 1–12 blocks (volume-adjusted).  
- **Finality**: 5 seconds (local) + Bitcoin-backed (after 100 DAG confirmations).  

### **2. Incentive Alignment**  
| Recipient       | Share of Fees | Purpose                          |  
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------|  
| Bitcoin Miners  | 15–50%       | Secure Bitcoin as rewards decline |  
| BTX Validators  | 82%          | Run Bitcoin full nodes           |  
| Core Dev Fund   | 3% (capped)  | Fund Bitcoin Core development    |  

### **3. Privacy & Offline Use**  
- **Default**: Encrypted addresses, DAG obfuscation, and unlinkable mint/burn.  
- **Offline TXs**: Signed offline, finalized via SMS/mesh when connected.  

### **4. Dual Wallet Design**  
|                | Human Wallets          | AI Wallets               |  
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|  
| **Use Case**   | Retail payments        | Machine microtransactions |  
| **Rules**      | Whole MOTO units only  | Sub-MOTO, batched TXs    |

## **Why Bitcoin Needs BTX**  
- **Sustains Security**: Fees from BTX’s high-volume DAG supplement miner revenue.  
- **Funds Core Devs**: Decentralized, transparent funding via Bitcoin-anchored hashes.  
- **Global Reach**: Works without internet (SMS/mesh).  

---

## **Get Involved**  
BTX is **100% open-source** (MIT). We need:  
- **Rust/Python devs** to build testnet components.  
- **Cryptographers** to audit privacy/fee models.  
- **Community advocates** to share the vision.   

*No corporate control. No tokens. Just Bitcoin.*
